释义：
have got to 应该做……
同理，have got to+动词所表达的含义与 have to+动词一样。I've gotta go 可以缩略为 I gotta go,因此 I gotta go 的原型是 I have got to go。
例句：
I've got to run. I'll call you later.
我得赶紧走了。回头给你打电话。
I have (got) to go. I have to ring up now.
我要走了。(电话）我得挂了。
You've got to be kidding!
开什么玩笑！
对话：
A: I've got to tell you something.
我有话要对你说。
B: No, no. You don't have to explain yourself to me.
不用了，没必要和我解释。
