释义：
It's not that... 不是……
用来表达否定的句式。It's not that... 表示“不是那样的”，后面接形容词的话表示“不到那种程度”，It's not that 主语+动词就表示“不是那样”，用来否定对方的想法。
例句：
It's not that we're not having a lot of fun at the party.
我们并没有在聚会中感到无聊。
It's not that we don't care about the employees.
我们并非不关心员工。
It's not that we don't like you.
我们并不是不喜欢你。
对话：
A: You really don't like me, do you?
你真的不喜欢我，是吧？
B: It's not that I don't like you. I just don't know you.
并不是我不喜欢你。只是不太了解你罢了。
