释义：
as you (probably) know 正如……所知
as you know 用来表示“正如你所知”。想要说“正如大家所知”的话就要说成 as we know。 you know 则充当说话前的一种语气词，表示“我说”，“那个”等。另外，as far as somebody knows 表示“只要某人知道”。
例句：
As you know, it's my job to interview people.
你也知道，我的工作就是见各种人。
You know, everything is going to be fine.
你知道，一切都会好的。
As far as I know she didn't show up at the party.
据我所知，她没有参加派对。
对话：
A: As far as I know they sent it yesterday.
据我所知，他们昨天送过来了。
B: Then it should arrive later today.
那应该在今天晚些时候到。
