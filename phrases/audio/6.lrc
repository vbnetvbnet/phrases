释义：
get it (me，you) 理解
get 用作“理解....”（understand)的意思，I don't get it 就是 I don't understand it 的口语表达方式。可以用 you 代替 it,变成 I don't get you。
例句：
I need to be with someone who gets me.
我需要和理解我的人在一起。
I don't get it. Why are you late again?
真搞不懂，你怎么又迟到了？
You got that right. It's the best restaurant in town.
你说的没错，这是城里最好的餐厅。
对话：
A: Let me know if she likes me, okay?
告诉我她到底喜不喜欢我，好不？
B: You got it.
你知道的。
