释义：
come to+动词 着手做某事，来做某事
come to+动词表示“着手做某事”，如果强调 come 的含义的话，就表示“来做某事”。另外，用到 come here 的 I come here to ..., Did you come here to ... ?等也需要记住。
例句：
You'll come to understand me.
你会理解我的。
She came to realize that she was stupid.
她开始意识自己的愚蠢。
I came to apologize to you.
我是来向你道歉的。
I came here to let you know that I love you.
我是来让你知道，我爱你。
对话：
A: I came to see your new car.
我是来看你的新车的。
B: This is it. Do you like it?
就是这辆，怎么样?
