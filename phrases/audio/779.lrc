get paid 得到支付，拿到薪水
We're not leaving until we get paid! 如果我们拿不到钱，就绝对不会离开！
We work. We get paid. You don't owe me anything. 我们工作就有薪水，你没有欠我什么。
Some guys get paid a great deal of money for it. 有些人因为这件事得到了一大笔钱。
If you ask me, we aren't getting paid enough. 要我说的话，我们拿到的薪水肯定不够。
That's true, but we don't have a choice. 没错，不过我们也没有别的选择了。
